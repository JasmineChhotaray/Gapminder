# Gapminder
Hans Rosling's Gapminder project
================================
Recreated Hans Rosling's Gapminder animated plot.

The objective is to show in visualization how the world has undergone change over the last few years in terms of life expectancy, population and fertility.


I have highlighted the 3 major economies i.e., India, China and US in my graph.
